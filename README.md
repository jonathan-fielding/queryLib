# Simple State Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathan-fielding/SimpleStateManager.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathan-fielding/SimpleStateManager)

Simple State Manager (SSM for short) is a javascript state manager for responsive websites. It is built to be light weight, has no dependencies (except javascript of course) and aims to be really easy to simply drop into your project ready to use.

As a state manager, SSM allows you to target different javascript towards different states of your site. It allows you to define as many states as your site requires and allows you to have independent Enter, Leave and Resize events for each of the states.

##Getting started

To get started with SSM the first step is to include it in your project, you can do this in two ways

* Download and add the ssm.js (or ssm.min.js) file to your site
* Use Bower to add to your project using bower install SimpleStateManager
